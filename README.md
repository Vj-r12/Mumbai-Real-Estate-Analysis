The Mumbai Real Estate Analysis project is an end-to-end exploration conducted on the Snowflake Cloud platform. Beginning with data extraction from 99 Acres via Kaggle, the raw dataset was seamlessly imported into Snowflake. The project involved creating a dedicated database, warehouse, file format, and stage within Snowflake to facilitate efficient data management. Furthermore, various tables were meticulously designed and implemented to structure and organize the imported real estate data. This comprehensive endeavor encompasses the entire spectrum of real estate data processing, from creating the necessary infrastructure to the final analytical stages. It highlights not only the insights derived from the analysis but also the meticulous setup of the Snowflake environment to handle and process diverse datasets with precision.


"The Mumbai Real Estate Analysis project, executed on the robust Snowflake Cloud platform, delves into a comprehensive exploration of property prices for sales and rentals across various types in distinct locations. The analyzed property types include Residential Apartments, Independent Houses/Villas, Residential Land, Independent/Builder Floors, Farm Houses, Serviced Apartments, and Studio Apartments. The study encompasses diverse city areas, including Central Mumbai Suburbs, Mumbai Beyond Thane, Mira Road, Thane, Mumbai South West, Navi Mumbai, Mumbai Harbour, South Mumbai, and Mumbai Andheri Dahisar. The project not only scrutinizes the nuances of property pricing but also strategically captures the market dynamics in different regions, offering a nuanced understanding of Mumbai's multifaceted real estate landscape."
